We was trolled by the organizer at first. Initially we thought this is the correct flag wgmy{do_you_wanna_play_a_game} but when we try submit , server refusing to accept it. So now what? Take another look into the text

Hmm, with the help of google-fu, we found this web spam mimic ctrl c + V given text and decode it

```
flag: wgmy:{spam_spam_spam}
```
